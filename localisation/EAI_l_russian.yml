It is possible for them to join Axis later depending on the war develops.\n\n"Aggressive Germany" makes the AI Germany take France for itself and invade the rest of the European minors sooner than normally."

The default settings are how this mod is meant to be played.\n\nGame balance settings: these settings change the overall balance of the game.\n\nDifficulty settings: add various bonuses for the AI to create a better challenge.

 EAI_M.1030.d:0 ""Free convoys for AI majors": because of the AI's poor convoy management, the AI's will start receiving free convoys if they are running low on them. Without this, the AI can easily be crippled and freeze in all its operations.\n\n"Improved AI lend-lease logic": this vastly increases every AI nation's willingness to lend-lease to other AIs and they will take into account many factors when determining if it is a good idea to lend-lease."

 EAI_H.1001.d:0 "This bonus modifier is applied to any AI country at war with a player and removed once the war is over. This can be enabled at the same time with specific country bonuses and they do not stack.\n\nWhy use this? It stops the AI from building ridiculous air forces and army sizes before the war but gives their industry the necessary boost during wars to keep them challenging. It also works for any AI country and any diplomatic situation that might develop unlike the predetermined bonuses."

 EAI_M.1104.d:0 "AI focuses determine what kind of an army the AI creates: what it researches, the designs it makes, what it builds and how much it builds. AI normally chooses these focuses on its own.\n\nBy default, most nations have some restrictions to which focus options the AI is allowed to choose. This can be disabled to give the AI more freedom. The AI will still weigh various focus choices so that it should create a somewhat sensible army for itself.\n\nYou can also directly choose focuses for an AI country to make it build whatever you think works best for it. It is possible to reset these focuses later in game and reconfigure them but changing them too much would not work very well."
 EAI_M.102.d:0 "Main armor focus. This determines the main tank type that the AI attempts to build early in the game. AT focus makes it focus on anti-tank infantry instead of tanks.\n\nA country with either medium or heavy armor focus will use medium or heavy tank destroyers in its AT infantry divisions respectively."
 EAI_M.104.d:0 "Secondary armor focus. Medium or heavy armor attachment divisions will only be built later in the game if the situation is right.\n\nIf the AI has AT focus, the type of AT infantry division it creates depends on this choice. With medium or heavy armor attachment it uses medium or heavy tank destroyers in its AT infantry divisions respectively and with motorized attachment it will use regular line AT."

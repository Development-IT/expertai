Expert AI v3.0:

-rewritten AI construction scripts: AI prioritizes high infrastructure states in its construction strategy, added more logic to it (if it has tons of MIC, maybe queue up some refineries or docks as well etc.). Easier to edit country specific construction setups for anyone interested.

-rewritten AI variant scripts: AI takes into account how much XP it actually has and develops variants as it gains XP (means there is virtually no cheating on the AI's part here anymore and in many cases it ends up with even better variants than before). It develops better variants and for more types of equipment (CVs with maxed deckspace, STRATS with maxed bombing etc.). Scripting in country specific variant upgrade paths is very simple now though at the moment I'm using it only to give unique names to major countries' variants. Countries that like to use a lot of armor will also max out their medium tank first while other countries will max out MSPAA first plus similar stuff for air variants.

-AI uses research bonuses much better. The AI modifiers were growing to ridiculous sizes so I scripted it in a simpler way if anyone wants to edit them.

-production scripts have have been changed to work with the new patch and I did some rebalancing on all nations along the way. This is going to take a lot more testing to really flesh out but it seems to work well enough at the moment.

-AI majors don't always go for the same land doctrine; USA might go for Mobile Warfare instead or Japan might switch to Superior Firepower etc.

-Germany will stockpile plenty of equipment before attacking USSR and makes sure it has a decent amount of armor divisions.

-AI should be better at building up a stockpile that roughly scales with its army size before building even more units i. e. for 3 million troops, keep a stockpile of 100k infantry equipment.

-GER/ITA use Dispersed Industry. Seems like a good idea now.

-AI uses flexible line instead of streamlined line.

-all AIs research synthetic factory tech and most majors build at least a few. It will also research one additional level if it runs out of free slots on high infrastructure states in core territories.

-more priority on researching maintenance company since it's so much weaker now (is this worth using at all anymore? - needs more testing)

-JAP/ENG/USA/ITA better at getting important naval techs researched

-GER/USA/ENG/SOV use 22-width 8/2 infantry templates. I don't want 6/3 infantry templates used now that artillery is significantly weaker.

-AI won't put too much effort into building early type capital ships.

-removed a lot of scripts that are unnecessary as of the new patch

-removed the ugly solution to fixing the infuriating template bug where I have to give the AI 500 land xp. The new fix should be reliable enough without doing this.

-fascists and communists use the harshest occupation policy on most countries. Others use gentle.
